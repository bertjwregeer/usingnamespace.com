TODO:

- Move remote_addr from user_tickets and user_api_tickets into a seperate table
  so that one can see a list of what remote endpoints have used a particular
  ticket. This will allow user for example to know if their API token has been
  stolen, or if their session is being used from a location they aren't
  expecting.
